Below is a comprehensive `README.md` for the ETL project. It includes step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project.

# **ETL Project with Python, PostgreSQL, and Docker**

This project demonstrates an Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process using Python and SQL. The data is extracted from a CSV file, transformed, and loaded into a PostgreSQL database. The entire setup is containerized using Docker Compose.

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Docker**: [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- **Docker Compose**: Ensure Docker Compose is installed (usually included with Docker Desktop).

---

## **Project Structure**
Here’s the structure of the project:

```
project/
├── etl.py               # Python script for the ETL process
├── data.csv             # Sample CSV file containing input data
├── requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
├── docker-compose.yml   # Docker Compose configuration
├── Dockerfile           # Defines the environment for the ETL service
└── init.sql             # SQL script to initialize the database schema
```

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Clone or Download the Project**
If you cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/project
```

### **Step 2: Build the Docker Images**
Run the following command to build the Docker images and start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command:
- Builds the `etl` service using the `Dockerfile`.
- Starts the PostgreSQL (`db`) service.
- Initializes the database schema using the `init.sql` script.
- Runs the `etl.py` script to perform the ETL process.

### **Step 3: Verify the Setup**
Once the containers are running, you should see output indicating that the ETL process has completed successfully.

---

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Option 1: Run in Foreground**
To run the project in the foreground (useful for debugging):
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### **Option 2: Run in Background**
To run the project in the background:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### **Stopping the Containers**
To stop the containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## **Verifying the Data in the Database**

After the ETL process completes, you can verify that the data has been loaded into the PostgreSQL database.

1. Connect to the PostgreSQL container using `psql`:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <db_container_id> psql -U myuser -d mydatabase
   ```

   To find the `<db_container_id>`:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

2. Once connected, run the following SQL query to view the data:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM users;
   ```

You should see the transformed data from the `data.csv` file.

---

## **Customization**

### **1. Modify the Input Data**
- Update the `data.csv` file with your own dataset.
- Ensure the column names match the schema defined in `init.sql`.

### **2. Modify the Transformation Logic**
- Edit the `transform` function in `etl.py` to apply custom transformations to the data.

### **3. Change the Database Credentials**
- Update the `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file under the `db` service.

### **4. Add More Tables or Columns**
- Modify the `init.sql` file to add more tables or columns to the database schema.
